HEY!! Thanks for having look at my Repo :)
Here are the instructions if u want to use this framework:

1. Install Eclipse/ any editor
2. Fork/clone this repository to your account/ Local
3. open this project in your IDE(eclipse) / editor 
4. Add a folder browser-drivers and put the browser executables in that folder
5. Under test-data folder there is a file data.xlsx. In that sheet put your login details.
6. Build this project by Maven pom.xml

And thats all! Do run as maven test.
This code will login to twitter and search for POTUS and follow. After following, it will verify whether your profile is following POTUS or not. 
After that it will unfollow and log out.
